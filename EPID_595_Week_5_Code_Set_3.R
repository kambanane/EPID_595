# Finding clusters and hotspots in disease incidence data
# Finding clusters and hotspots in disease incidence data in R

# This code shows how to identify clusters and hoptspots in disease incidence data using disease mapping models.
# Specifically, we focus on the two disease mapping models that model the observed number of cases of a disease
# as following a Poisson distribution with mean equal to the expected number of cases times a log relative risk.

# The relative risk, in one case, is modeled as a linear combination of explanatory variables and spatial random
# effects. This is the disease mapping model with CAR spatial random effects.

# The second disease mapping model is Besag-York-Mollieâ€™ or the BYM disease mapping model which includes both spatial and non-spatial random effects in the model for the log relative risks.
# For the analysis, we will need the R packages: maps, maptools, spdep, RColorBrewer, classInt, and CARBayes. All these packages can be downloaded from a CRAN repository.
# The dataset that we will use is a dataset reporting the number of cases of lung cancer in Pennsylvania in 2002 for different strata of the population. Here we focus on 60-69 years olds.
